# Claude Orchestrator Configuration

## Purpose

This file defines how Claude orchestrates subagents and skills for the SDLC in this repository. Agents handle specific tasks; skills provide templates and domain knowledge.

## Project: Retail Demo

Microsoft Fabric retail demo powered by synthetic data generation.

### Key Components
- **utility**: Fabric-native `retail-setup` utility (CLI: configure/render/deploy) and setup notebooks that generate synthetic retail data directly in Fabric Spark (active path)
- **deploy**: Terraform + fabric-cicd deployment framework
- **fabric/kql_database**: KQL scripts for Eventhouse tables, functions, materialized views
- **fabric/lakehouse**: PySpark notebooks for Lakehouse Bronze -> Silver -> Gold transforms and ML
- **utility stream-events notebook**: Spark Structured Streaming that writes synthetic events directly to the Eventhouse KQL tables via the Spark Kusto connector
- **docs**: Canonical Zensical source for guides, requirements, specifications, architecture, security, and traceability

### Reference Files
- Streaming event payloads: `utility/notebooks/templates/driver-05-stream.py`
- Lakehouse table contract: `utility/src/retail_setup/generation/schemas.py`
- KQL tables: `fabric/kql_database/01-create-tables.kql`
- Silver transforms: `fabric/lakehouse/03-streaming-to-silver.ipynb`
- Gold aggregations: `fabric/lakehouse/04-streaming-to-gold.ipynb`

## Quickstart

1. Read `STATUS.md` first to understand current state
2. Follow wave sequence: A -> B -> C -> D -> E
3. Use agents listed below for each wave
4. Agents auto-load their activity skills with templates
5. Update `STATUS.md` after completing any wave (see `restartability` skill)

**Quick decision:**
- New repo or unfamiliar codebase? -> Start at Wave A
- Small bugfix in familiar code? -> Skip to Wave D
- Major feature or refactor? -> Full wave sequence

## Global Norms

- Be truthful; avoid fabricating APIs, tools, or behavior
- Respect the wave sequence
- Follow priority order: Security > Correctness > Performance > Maintainability
- **NEVER merge pull requests** — PR merges require human approval and must be performed by a team member, not Claude

## Project-Specific Guidelines

### Column Naming Convention

**Standard:** Use `snake_case` for new column names throughout the data pipeline.

**Rationale:**
- Aligns with Python (PEP 8) naming conventions used in the data generator
- Consistent with KQL table names and event types
- Avoids case-sensitivity issues across platforms
- Improves readability in SQL and KQL queries

**Scope:**
- Lakehouse Silver dimension and fact tables (utility generator output)
- KQL event tables in Eventhouse (cusn schema)
- Lakehouse Silver tables (silver schema)
- Lakehouse Gold tables (gold schema)

**Examples:**
- Correct: `event_ts`, `receipt_id_ext`, `customer_id`, `store_id`
- Incorrect: `EventTs`, `ReceiptIdExt`, `customerId`, `storeId`

**Exceptions:**
- Existing physical schemas retain some PascalCase and mixed-case fields for
  compatibility with current TMDL bindings.
- Semantic Model display names can use user-friendly formats (e.g.,
  "Event Timestamp", "Receipt ID").
- Always verify the authoritative schema instead of renaming existing fields by
  convention alone.

### KQL Development
- Use `.execute database script` for batch operations
- Number scripts for execution order (01, 02, 03...)
- Event tables use snake_case (e.g., `receipt_created`)
- Use materialized views for pre-aggregated KPIs

### Python/PySpark
- Follow PEP 8 formatting
- Use type hints for function signatures
- Prefer Pydantic models for data structures

### PySpark Transform Development
**Critical:** When implementing transforms that map event data to fact/dimension tables:

1. **Always reference source schemas first** before writing transform code
   - Streaming event payloads: `utility/notebooks/templates/driver-05-stream.py` (`EVENT_PAYLOADS`)
   - Lakehouse table contract: `utility/src/retail_setup/generation/schemas.py` (`TABLES`)
   - Find the relevant event payload (e.g., `reorder_triggered`)
   - Verify exact field names and types in the source schema

2. **Validate field mappings** by cross-referencing:
   - Source: Event payload schema in `schemas.py`
   - Target: Destination table schema (KQL or Lakehouse)
   - Ensure column names match exactly (case-sensitive)

3. **Common mistake to avoid:**
   - DO NOT guess or infer field names from context
   - DO NOT assume similar field names across different event types
   - DO NOT rely on outdated documentation or examples

**Example workflow:**
```
1. Read event payloads: utility/notebooks/templates/driver-05-stream.py
2. Identify exact field names (e.g., reorder_quantity, not quantity_ordered)
3. Write transform using F.col("reorder_quantity")
4. Validate against both source schema and target table
```

### Data Architecture
- Event tables: Streaming-only (from the stream-events notebook via the Spark Kusto connector)
- Dimension/Fact tables: Historical setup notebooks write the base contract directly to Lakehouse
- Eventhouse shortcuts: Optional streaming projection into Lakehouse Silver/Gold
- Gold layer: Aggregations built in PySpark notebooks

## When NOT to Over-Parallelize

- Multiple agents editing the same file
- One agent depends on another's reasoning (not just artifacts)
- Trivial edits where overhead outweighs benefit
- Changes < ~50 lines in a single file
- Tasks completable directly in < 2 minutes

## Open Issues

The fact tables formerly tracked in issues #7-#13 (fact_payments, fact_stockouts,
fact_reorders, fact_promotions, fact_store_ops, fact_customer_zone_changes) and the
`truck_departed` event are all implemented — see
`utility/src/retail_setup/generation/schemas.py` and
`utility/notebooks/templates/driver-05-stream.py`. Check the GitHub issue tracker
for current open work.

## Lessons Learned

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**Timestamps & Time Zones**
- Always use UTC with timezone info: `datetime.now(timezone.utc)`
- Event timestamps must be monotonically increasing within a batch
- Use `pd.Timestamp.utcnow()` in pandas, not `pd.Timestamp.now()`

**KQL**
- Materialized view names must be unique across the entire database
- Always wrap multi-statement scripts in `.execute database script <|`
- Test KQL locally with sample data before deploying to Fabric

**Pydantic**
- Use `model_dump()` not deprecated `.dict()` (Pydantic v2)
- Use `model_validate()` not deprecated `.parse_obj()`
- Define `model_config` not inner `class Config`

**Streaming**
- Events can arrive out of order; design consumers accordingly
- Use partition keys for ordering guarantees within a partition
- Set reasonable batch sizes (100-500 events) to balance latency vs throughput

### Past Incidents

_Document issues and their resolutions here as they occur:_

- **2026-01-28**: Schema field name mismatch in reorder transform (PR #224)
  - Root cause: Transform referenced `quantity_ordered` instead of `reorder_quantity` from source schema
  - Fix: Code review caught the error before production deployment
  - Prevention: Added PySpark Transform Development section requiring schema validation before implementation
